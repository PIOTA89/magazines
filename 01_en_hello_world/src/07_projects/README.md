LET‘S GET PRACTICAL

# Projects

<div class="introdution">
Have you ever had this euphoric moment when something clicks and you have an excellent idea? Of course, who hasn‘t experienced this! But an idea alone does not change anything. An idea becomes influential only if people put their minds, hands and hearts together and cut a diamond out of the idea – a project is born. Thousands of ideas are slumbering in the IOTA universe, and hundreds of projects are actively promoted by our Community. We would like to thank you for all your hard work and your love. We proudly present the 30 projects of the week that have accumulated over the past year. We are also delighted to present Deposy – the project of the year chosen by the Community.
