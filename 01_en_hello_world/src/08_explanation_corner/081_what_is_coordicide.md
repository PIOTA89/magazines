TEXT HAGI

To understand the great expectations connected with the so-called Coordicide, it is worth while taking a little trip into the past. The origin of the name goes back to the Coordinator, a central unit of the IOTA protocol which has been used to date preventively as a protective measure against fraud. The Coordinator generates so- called milestones in regular time intervals. Other transactions must be oriented towards these milestones directly or indirectly in order to be confirmed as genuine transactions in the network. Since the Coordinator as the central unit of the Foundation constitutes a sort of guardian ensuring law and order, security is guaranteed, but an elementary aspect of the DLT promise, decentrality, is not given (see illustration above).
Critics never tire of emphasizing this weak point in comparison with other projects, because as long as decentrality is not given, the IOTA protocol only has a limited value for Industry 4.0 and the new data era (“Data is the new oil”). After all, the users are supposed to regain control over their own data, which is hard to imagine with a central unit in action.


So, let‘s note: The Coordicide is intended to act as a foundation for scalability, security and decentrality. Estimates expect 75 billion networked IoT devices until 2025.
The illustration above shows the core objectives of distributed ledger technology (DLT). Since no project to date has managed to reconcile security, decentrality and scalability, we refer to a trilemma.
In order to get closer to a solution of the trilemma for the first time in the young history of DLT, according to the developers, more than 20 employees of the IOTA Foundation are currently (as of October 2019) working on research and technical development for this fundamental change.

## The Next Steps
With regard to the timeframe in which to expect a possible test network, the research results remain thrilling as well as unexpected for the outsider. Enthusiasts need to get used to the idea that the IOTA Foundation may be close to a solution but the research around this cutting-edge technology keeps unexpected barriers in stock, which have to be overcome in a sustainable and, above all, secure way with the help of meaningful test results and studies.
Let‘s remember that the protocol is supposed to become the backbone of the Internet of Things. Billions of devices will be networked one day, exchanging sensitive data and monetary transactions in real time.
A gross error with regard to security may cost us the crucial trust we need in order to inspire big players in the industry for this promising technology.

## Conclusion
With the Coordicide, that is, by eliminating the Coordinator, IOTA wants to be a pioneer in leaving behind an apparently insoluble problem in the DLT area. Scalability, security and decentrality should not be limited. Therefore, we keep putting down stone after stone every day for a strong foundation on which eventually an industry worth trillions will be placed.
