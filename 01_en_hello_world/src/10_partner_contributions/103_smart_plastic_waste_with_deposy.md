# Smart Plastic Waste with Deposy 

<div class="introdution">
Deposy is an innovative deposit system and a new way of dealing with waste. State-of- the-art technology allows for more effective protection of the environment and climate. The Deposy system is socially acceptable both on a global and a local scale.

It is the age of climate change. The big global problems need to be addressed quickly to prevent the worst from happening. Among the big problems are global CO2 emissions and a flood of plastic waste. The topic of a sustainable society is becoming ever more pressing. Many states, cities and companies, but also private persons, already are committed to a sustainable society now.
Of course, many of those who live in an affluent society do not want to give up the achievements of this society. But we undoubtedly need to change our way of thinking. From my point of view, there is no doubt that we need to employ new technologies in order to change things while at the same time preserving a certain part of our wealth. This is why we, the BIOTA e.V. (i.G.), are working on a novel deposit system based on IOTA and the Tangle technology.

## The Economic Costs of Plastic Waste Are Constantly on the Rise
With the novel Deposy deposit system, we would like to tackle several problems at once. That is, we would like to contribute to a reduction in plastic waste and cut down CO2 emissions at the same time. Before I describe the system, I would like to present a few important facts and figures. According to a study by the management consulting firm McKinsey, more then 30 percent of all plastic wrappings do not end up in a sorted recycling circuit but are disposed of in different, polluting ways. The economic costs arising from this are estimated to be 40 billion dollars per year. Microplastic particles, which form when plastic waste deteriorates, are taken in by humans and animals via food and air. Experts consider this to entail increased health hazards.
In times like these, where the greatest efforts are made to prevent damaging greenhouse gases on all levels, plastic recycling makes a significant contribution to climate protection. For each kilogram of recycled plastic, around 2 kg of CO2 can be saved, depending on the type of plastic. However, without proper waste separation and sorting, there is no recycling, because everything that ends up in the household waste is burned in incineration plants. If, in contrast, other types of garbage than plastic packagings are thrown into the plastic recycling circuit, this makes sorting, and thus the whole recycling, more difficult. The sorting machines are specialized on packagings; everything else is combed out and burned. Unfortunately, this often leads to a significant loss of recyclable plastic.

## Fighting Plastic Waste and Cutting Down CO Emissions with IOTA 2
All of this was reason enough for us, BIOTA e.V., to start the innovative Deposy project. The project‘s approach is to obtain well-sorted plastic waste with the help of a special deposit system, which also gives people incentives to collect and sort plastic waste. The system we have developed is based on IOTA‘s characteristics, which are perfectly suited for this purpose, namely distributed ledger technology. IOTA is a young cryptocurrency that allows for fast, secure and cost-free transfer of data and finances. A traditional
system processed via banks could not meet the requirements. Because of the energy-consuming mining, that is, the generation of new units, cryptocurrencies have been facing increasing criticism over the past few months. Experts estimate the mining activities for one US dollar‘s worth of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero to have taken up the following average
amounts of energy between January 1, 2016, and June 30, 2018:
    • Bitcoin: 17 MJ
    • Ethereum: 7 MJ
    • Litecoin: 7 MJS
    • Monero 14 MJ

With IOTA, this is different, because no mining is needed for this innovative technology. Of course, IOTA nodes and transactions also require computing power and thus consume electricity, but compared to the energy consumption caused by traditional blockchain technology, this is insignificant.
This is another reason why we at Deposy are using the IOTA/ Tangle technology. We want to go for sustainability right from the start with this system.

## Results Through Incentives
The basic precondition for successfully implementing IOTA consists in its scalability without exponentially increasing costs, its system transparency and decentralized, secure process control. Micropayments can be made together with data transfers. Furthermore, the system can be used outside of the insitutions normally necessary for deposit systems such as shops, for instance. If you think globally, this characteristic may be tremendously important. There are several things that make the Deposy system stand out from others. The population is given a financial incentive to collect, sort and return plastic waste. They get paid more than they paid for the deposit in the first place. Application is easy. It is based on IOTA, a modern distributed ledger technology, and could be implemented world-wide. Collectors receive deposit payments either into their IOTA wallets or, thanks to cooperations, to their bank accounts in their local currency, e.g. in euros. Automatic sorting of plastic waste is still difficult today and also consumes a lot of energy. Moreover, recycling plastic consumes far less energy than producing new plastic from scratch. This way, the deposit system helps to cut down CO2 emissions and to reach the climate goals. The system facilitates reaching the recycling goals for the industry, because it renders the expensive, automatic sorting step unnecessary.

## Product IDs Make Plastic Smart
As described above, Deposy uses the characteristics of the IOTA cryptocurrency in combination with the Tangle. IOTA is used for payments to avoid transaction costs, while the trasmission and validation of the product data is carried out by the Tangle. This way, every plastic packaging is given an unchangeable identity. For the implementation of the Deposy project, the following aspects are key: 
    • Protection of the environment
    • Security
    • Product identity
    • Trust

There are a few examples of barcode-based deposit systems, such as the German PET deposit system for reusable plastic bottles. However, through manipulations of the deposit system with copied labels, frauds are estimated to have summed up to more than 100 million euros since 2014, according to experts. This is a huge sum. We want to avoid this with Deposy. In our system, plastic parts are given identities by means of QR codes. This ID is unambiguous and is invalidated upon return of the deposit. This means that any QR code can only be used exactly once. This procedure helps to build trust with plastic producers and system participants.
What else is a product ID useful for? For us, the Deposy product ID means that important information on the product is stored securely on the Tangle throughout its entire lifecycle. There may be vast amounts of information, but the most important bits for our system are product properties and the carbon footprint of plastic. The product properties grant proper sorting within the machines. With the help of the product property information, recyclers can register the composition of the plastic waste exactly. The carbon footprint information may become important in the future if we want to register the amount of carbon saved. Much more information can be registered on the Tangle with further development, if desired.
During the last few weeks, we have been discussing a lot with stakeholders from the industry and companies. We have recently made funding proposals for the implementation of this system, and research institutions are going to accompany this project from a scientific point of view. A few offers have been made for test stands already. If everything goes down well, we hope to be implementing a test system within the next six months.
