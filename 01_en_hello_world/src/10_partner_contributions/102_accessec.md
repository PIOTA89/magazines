# Accessec

<div class="introdution">
A little more than a year ago, accessec GmbH realized its first IOTA-related project: the Trinity Wallet Audit.

Founded in 2008 in the town of Groß-Bieberau, accessec GmbH successfully provides IT-security consulting for businesses and institutions from nearly all sectors of the economy, both in Germany and internationally. accessec was one of the first consulting companies in the DACH countries (German-speaking Europe) that focused on identity-centric strategies and solutions for the IoT, automotive security and Industry 4.0. Our success lies in the great innovative strength of our team who keep dealing with ever new technologies and methods in the manufacturing industry and the automotive sector in Germany, underpinned by our strong research activities. Based on this and on our fascination with the potential of IOTA, a partnership with the IOTA Foundation started to form roughly a year ago, to make the world a tiny bit safer.

## Sorry, Who?
Since April 2019, accessec has taken on board two new managers: Markus Soppa and Sven Feuchtmüller. They are taking over the helm from Sebastian Rohr, who, among other things, was co-responsible for accessec‘s security testing of the Trinity Wallet. Sven and Markus will further push the new strategic orientation towards distributed ledger consulting with a focus on IOTA both with accessec and within the Community. The company will also focus more strongly on developing their own IOTA-based products.

## Identities for All!
Due to its experience in the field, accessec already saw the potential of a decentralized identity solution facing the main challenges in the field of industrial IoT early on. The accessec team would also like to involve IOTA technology in motorized traffic, which is facing the biggest change in its entire history, due to the development of autonomous, automated and networked driving. Vehicles will be able to communicate and drive autonomously. To achieve this, it is crucial that technical systems can be used independently of their manufacturer and that general interfaces are created both on the conceptional and the technical level. A procedure like this rules out proprietary solutions.
Communication in the future will happen not only between
all sorts of vehicles but also with the road network and the IT infrastructure of manufacturers, road operators and others. Moreover, we can expect communication infrastructure to assume a new role by providing central components in addition to its decentrally executed functions and even taking over special partial functions in automatization.

## Wasn‘t That Called Libra?
This is exactly where accessec sees the great potential of the IOTA technology. Following the development of its own vehicle DID solution, Cyonis, accessec will test its feasibility and usability in a real environment during the next few months.
The envisioned product name Libra, which had originally been suggested by the IOTA Community, had to be dismissed again two weeks later when Facebook launched its own cryptocurrency by the same name.
