# IOTA Team Karlsruhe

<div class="introdution">
While many are still discussing whether IOTA has the potential to become the backbone of the IoT, we are already busy realizing this goal – Let’s build it!

The IOTA Team Karlsruhe does not have an official founding date but rather has been growing continually since January 2019. Starting with the degree thesis of one of our members, we begun establishing contact with the IOTA Community and were quickly able to find further IOTA enthusiasts from Karlsruhe.
After first meeting and getting to know each other, we quickly took the decision to hold the first Karlsruhe meetup and to strengthen our contact with the IOTA Community. Driven by the idea of speaking about more than just the theoretical aspects of the IOTA technology at the meetup, we developed our own IOTA prototype. Our goal was to illustrate the techncial characteristics of the IOTA protocol for our visitors at the meetup and thus allow for a direct interaction with the Tangle.
Motivated by the visitors‘ positive feedback and the successful publication of our first IOTA prototype for an open and decentralized mobility marketplace, our steadily growing team is currently working on the technical challenges posed by the Tangle. We see ourselves as a young team of researchers who, together with the Community, would like to design the future of machine economy and an open and scalable networking between various machines.
For this purpose, we take on different tasks, such as flexible access management of continuous IoT data streams on the Tangle (Raphael Manke), with secure and accelerated hardware (Marvin Gnad), scalable and decentralized identity and trust management (Christian Fries & Robin Lamberti) as well as automated trade with small amounts of data (Felix Kretzer).
