The IOTA Foundation has grown rapidly in the last few years. Since its establishment in 2015, it has hired more than 100 employees. The main goal of the first few years was to establish a stable organizational culture. To stay on top of things with a team that is spread all over the world and growing at such speed is an unparalleled challenge. How does IOTA meet this challenge concretely?

## SumSum
To really act in concert, the team members need to get to know each other in person and develop personal relationships. For this purpose, there is the annual SummerSummit, or SumSum for short. This event is organized for the team to celebrate successes, present news and novelties and discuss new ideas. The SumSum also is the perfect opportunity to get to know the person behind an online username. This article‘s header picture shows the IOTA team at the 2019 SumSum.

## IOTA Hubs
With team members from more than 23 countries, a large part of the communication obviously happens exclusively over the internet. To give the team the opportunity to work together more closely, we have more and more offices spreading around the world, the so- called IOTA Hubs. Currently there are hubs in Berlin, Tel Aviv, Oslo and Taipei. In these hubs, the team can work together and also meet with important partners.

The picture above shows the Tel Aviv team, which is led by Alon Elmaliah (on the right). Tel Aviv is a renowned center of technology, which keeps popping up in top 10 start-up reviews. Tel Aviv is home to many start-ups and companies. Also big software companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Intel are established in Israel. The biggest sectors in the Isreali technology scene are cyber security and biotechnology.
IOTA‘s four current hubs are just the beginning. Stay tuned to find out when and where the next hub will open its gates.

## Strong Team of Developers
The team behind the Tangle, the tools and the libraries consists of many experienced software developers. The fact that these developers are spread all over the world and live in different time zones enables us to keep developing around the clock. Our open- source code is updated hourly. The Community takes part here in two ways: as developers and testers. The Community is formed by roughly 70,000 people, many of whom are looking at every single change in the code with a critical eye, thus actively taking part in the development process.
There is also a council of elected Community members responsible for the latest full node software, which takes the Community‘s insights and experiences to the IOTA developers.
There are now libraries for working with the Tangle in almost every existing programming language. Various tools have been developed, for example a program that can install an IOTA full node with just one mouse click.
All this is the result of close cooperation between IOTA developers and the Community. Special chat channels were opened to speed up the exchange of ideas and problem solutions. The Community has even managed to get its own section on the popular developers‘ platform Stack Overflow. Stack Overflow helps developers to find solutions to urgent technical problems.

## Academic Research Council
In 2018, the IOTA Foundation announced its academic research council. An impressive research team has been put together, consisting of globally leading professors, doctoral students and other scientists. The council will cooperate closely with the research departments to define the strategic orientation of the technology and to place the IOTA reasearch in an academic framework. In September 2019, Professor Jon Crowcroft, one of the internationally most renowned researchers for distributed computing, joined the council.
