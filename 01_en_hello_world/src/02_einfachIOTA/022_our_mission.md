TEXT SEBASTAN HEUSSER

There are lots of publications, documentations and news coming from the IOTA Foundation and the Community, most of which are in English. Our team of authors collects and publishes relevant content on our website and translates it into German as well. Like this, we provide a collection of important information both in English and German. At einfachIOTA.de you can also find some articles written by our own team of authors about projects and events from the IOTA Ecosystem. We interview interesting people and even make our own videos.

## Project of the Week
We are constantly looking out for exciting projects that are related to IOTA in some way or the other. In our Project of the Week format, we zoom in one such project every week. By interviewing the founders we often gain new insights into the project and the vision behind it. We would like to give more attention to the projects with this series but also provide new space for networking, as many of the projects need to solve the same problems. We provide the teams and companies with a space to recognize such problems and to solve them together in a sustainable way. Projects get their own channel with us, where they can report on problems but also share news and experiences.

## IOTA Meetups
IOTA meetups are held all over the world. We support them with marketing, planning, assistance during the event itself, and of course with follow-up work as well. We also try to do on-site reporting, for example with live streamings, and record video content which our media team edits into awesome videos. If desired, we can also bring our exhibition stand. The stand illustrates various IOTA application examples and contains information on exciting projects from the IOTA Ecosystem.

## Workshops and Tutorials
Many people would like to start programming. However, apart from a
technical barrier, there is often also a language barrier. We therefore offer workshops and tutorials in programming for for everybody â€“ from beginners and IOTA newcomers up to experts. The Community provides step-by-step tutorials and tools for working with the Tangle and constantly improves them.

## Videos and Audio News
Our VoiceNews team reads and records certain news bits, so you can listen to the most important news on your way to work. We now have our own YouTube channel, too, where we publish videos about our meetups, presentations and other entertainment stuff, such as einfachCozmo. Cozmo is a little smart robot who likes IOTA a lot and who explains things in a playful way. Check it out!

## We Provide Answers
Do you have any questions about IOTA? The einfachIOTA Discord gives you the opportunity to ask your questions. Either the einfachIOTA team or the Community will sure be able to help you. In our What is...? series, we answer the most frequently asked questions with an article and a video.
