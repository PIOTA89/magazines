<div class="introdution">
Most of us don‘t even know each other‘s real name, and even less often do we know each other‘s face. We, the IOTA Community, are spread out over the entire world. We all have our own history in finding IOTA. But in spite of our diversity, we are all united through our vision. In this section, we show you one of the most beautiful meetups of the past year in a bunch of pictures. On top of this, we would like to invite you to some of our upcoming meetups. We really hope to meet you soon!
