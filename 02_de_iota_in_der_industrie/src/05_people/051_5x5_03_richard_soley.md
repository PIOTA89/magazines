## How did you find out about IOTA?
In 2017 I did a study of DLT’s and decided that none could serve as the basis for identity in an Industrial IoT setting; as executive director of OMG’s Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) that’s very important to me.  Most had huge downloads associated with them and tiny transaction rates.  Once introduced to Dominick Schiener I realized that IOTA would fit the bill; smaller download and millions of transactions per second.

## What are you currently working on?
OMG is currently starting a new consortium, the Digital Twin Consortium (DTC) dedicated to digital twins in every market but especially those markets that don’t currently use them like property management and construction.  Identity and transactions figure into that too!

## How do you keep yourself informed about news?
I am an avid fan of the BBC’s online site, but have been staying away since the impeachment news of the U.S. president started.  I don’t see that changing anything.

## What do you miss at IOTA?
What I miss at IOTA is the widespread adoption of Bitcoin’s Blockchain and some of the others.  I am convinced that people will soon recognize the inherant value of a DLT designed ab initio for inter-machine transactions!

## What do you love most about IOTA?
I think I’ve already said it, but the smaller download size and faster transaction rates of IOTA make it perfect for the inter-machine ecosystem of Industrial Internet of Things systems!
